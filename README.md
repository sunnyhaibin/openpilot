<details><summary><h3>üåû What is sunnypilot?</h3></summary>

---

[sunnypilot](https://github.com/sunnyhaibin/sunnypilot) is a fork of comma.ai's openpilot, an open source driver assistance system. sunnypilot offers the user a unique driving experience for over 250+ supported car makes and models with modified behaviors of driving assist engagements. sunnypilot complies with comma.ai's safety rules as accurately as possible.

</details>

<details><summary><h3>üöò Running on a dedicated device in a car</h3></summary>

---

To use sunnypilot in a car, you need the following:
* A supported device to run this software
    * a [comma three](https://comma.ai/shop/products/three), or
    * a comma two (only with older versions below 0.8.13)
* This software
* One of [the 290+ supported cars](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/CARS.md). We support Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan, Kia, Chrysler, Lexus, Acura, Audi, VW, Ford and more. If your car is not supported but has adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist, it's likely able to run sunnypilot.
* A [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/products/car-harness) to connect to your car

Detailed instructions for [how to mount the device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup).

</details>

<details><summary><h3>üöó Driving Enhancements</h3></summary>

---

### Modified Assistive Driving Safety (MADS)
The goal of Modified Assistive Driving Safety (MADS) is to enhance the user driving experience with modified behaviors of driving assist engagements. This feature complies with comma.ai's safety rules as accurately as possible with the following changes:
* sunnypilot Automatic Lane Centering (ALC) and ACC/SCC can be engaged independently of each other
* Dedicated button to toggle sunnypilot ALC:
    * `CRUISE (MAIN)` button: All supported cars on sunnypilot
        * `LFA` button: Newer HKG cars with `LFA` button
        * `LKAS` button: Honda, Toyota, Global Subaru
* `SET-` button enables ACC/SCC
* `CANCEL` button only disables ACC/SCC
* `CRUISE (MAIN)` must be `ON` to use ACC/SCC
* `CRUISE (MAIN)` button disables ACC/SCC completely when `OFF` **(strictly enforced in panda safety code)**

### Disengage Lateral ALC on Brake Press Mode toggle
Dedicated toggle to handle Lateral state on brake pedal press and release:
1. `ON`: `BRAKE pedal` press will pause Automatic Lane Centering; `BRAKE pedal` release will resume Automatic Lane Centering. Note: `BRAKE pedal` release will NOT resume ACC/SCC/Long control without explicit user engagement **(strictly enforced in panda safety code)**
2. `OFF`: `BRAKE pedal` press will NOT pause Automatic Lane Centering; `BRAKE pedal` release will NOT resume ACC/SCC/Long control without explicit user engagement **(strictly enforced in panda safety code)**


Certain features are only available with an active data connection, via:
* [comma Prime](https://comma.ai/prime) - Intuitive service provided directly by comma, or
* Personal Hotspot - From your mobile device, or a dedicated hotspot from a cellular carrier.


### Custom Stock Longitudinal Control
While using stock Adaptive/Smart Cruise Control, Custom Stock Longitudinal Control in sunnypilot allows sunnypilot to manipulate and take over the set speed on the car's dashboard.

**Supported Cars:**
* Hyundai/Kia/Genesis
    * CAN platform
    * CAN-FD platform with 0x1CF broadcasted in CAN traffic
* Honda Bosch
* Volkswagen MQB

**Instruction**

**üìó How to use Custom Longitudinal Control on sunnypilot **

When using Speed Limit, Vision, or Map based Turn control, you will be setting the "MAX" ACC speed on the sunnypilot display instead of the one in the dashboard. The car will then set the ACC setting in the dashboard to the targeted speed, but will never exceed the max speed set on the sunnypilot display. A quick press of the RES+ or SET- buttons will change this speed by 5 MPH or KM/H on the sunnypilot display, while a long deliberate press (about a 1/2 second press) changes it by 1 MPH or KM/H. DO NOT hold the RES+ or SET- buttons for longer that a 1 second. Either make quick or long deliberate presses only.

**‚Äº Where to look when setting ACC speed ‚Äº**

Do not look at the dashboard when setting your ACC max speed. Instead, only look at the one on the sunnypilot display, "MAX". The reason you need to look at the sunnypilot display is because sunnypilot will be changing the one in the dashboard. It will be adjusting it as needed, never raising it above the one set on the sunnypilot display. ONLY look at the MAX speed on the sunnypilot display when setting the ACC speed instead of the dashboard!

### Gap Adjust Cruise
This fork now allows supported openpilot longitudinal cars to adjust the cruise gap between the car and the lead car.

**Supported cars:**
* sunnypilot Longitudinal Control capable

üö®**PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION AND BE READY TO MANUALLY TAKE OVER AT ALL TIMES**

There are 4 modes to select on the steering wheel and/or the onroad camera screen:
* **Stock Gap**: Stock sunnypilot distance - 1.45 second profile
* **Mild Gap**: Semi-aggressive distance - 1.25 second profile
* üö®**Aggro Gap**üö®: Aggressive distance - 1.0 second profile
